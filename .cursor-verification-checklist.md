# Cursor AI Verification Checklist
## ⚠️ ALWAYS CHECK THIS BEFORE RESPONDING TO USER

**Purpose:** Prevent incorrect assumptions and ensure accurate responses

## 🔍 Pre-Response Verification Steps

### 1. **Feature Status Check**
Before claiming a feature is "not done" or "pending":
- ✅ Check git history: `git log --oneline --all --grep="feature-name"`
- ✅ Read implementation files to verify code exists
- ✅ Check documentation files for status (`.md` files)
- ✅ Look for test files or test results
- ✅ Check if feature was included in previous builds
- ✅ Verify actual implementation, not just documentation status

**DO NOT** assume something is incomplete based on:
- Documentation saying "pending"
- Comments in code
- TODO lists
- Status files that may be outdated

**DO** verify by:
- Checking actual code implementation
- Reviewing git commits
- Checking if it's been tested
- Verifying if it's in production builds

---

### 2. **Name/Email/Hardcoded Values Check**
Before changing any hardcoded values:
- ✅ Search entire codebase: `grep -r "value" .`
- ✅ Check all related files (not just one)
- ✅ Verify database values vs hardcoded values
- ✅ Check if values come from config/environment
- ✅ Verify if values are user-specific vs global defaults

---

### 3. **Implementation Completeness Check**
Before saying "this needs to be done":
- ✅ Read the actual code files (don't just grep)
- ✅ Check if there are multiple implementations (backup files, etc.)
- ✅ Verify git history shows completion
- ✅ Check if feature was tested
- ✅ Look for related documentation indicating completion

---

### 4. **Context Awareness**
Before making statements:
- ✅ Review conversation history for context
- ✅ Check what user has already done/tried
- ✅ Verify if user mentioned testing or deployment
- ✅ Check if feature was in previous builds
- ✅ Understand user's timeline (what happened when)

---

### 5. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

#### ❌ **DO NOT:**
- Claim something is "not done" based on outdated docs
- Assume implementation is incomplete without checking code
- Change values without checking all occurrences
- Suggest fixes for things that already work
- Ignore user's stated history (e.g., "I tested this")

#### ✅ **DO:**
- Verify actual code implementation
- Check git history for context
- Read implementation files completely
- Acknowledge user's testing/deployment history
- Ask clarifying questions if uncertain
- Be humble about uncertainty

## 📋 Specific Verification Patterns

### For Feature Status:
```bash
# 1. Check git history
git log --oneline --all --grep="feature-name" | head -10

# 2. Check implementation files
find . -name "*feature*" -type f

# 3. Check documentation
grep -r "feature-name" *.md

# 4. Check if tested
grep -r "test\|Test\|TEST" *feature*
```

### For Hardcoded Values:
```bash
# 1. Search for all occurrences
grep -r "value-to-check" . --exclude-dir=node_modules

# 2. Check all file types
grep -r "value" app/ lib/ components/

# 3. Verify context
grep -r "value" -A 5 -B 5
```

### For Implementation Checks:
```bash
# 1. Read actual implementation
read_file target_file.js

# 2. Check git history
git log -p --all -- target_file.js | head -50

# 3. Check related files
codebase_search "how does X work?"
```

## 🎯 Response Quality Checklist

Before sending a response, verify:

- [ ] Have I checked git history?
- [ ] Have I read the actual implementation files?
- [ ] Have I verified against user's stated history?
- [ ] Have I searched for all occurrences of changed values?
- [ ] Am I certain about my claims, or should I verify more?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged user's previous work/testing?
- [ ] Am I making assumptions or verifying facts?

## 📝 Example: Password Reset Feature

**What I Should Have Done:**
1. ✅ Checked `app/reset-password.js` - EXISTS and complete
2. ✅ Checked `app/_layout.js` - Deep link handling EXISTS
3. ✅ Checked `app/signin.js` - Forgot password flow EXISTS
4. ✅ Checked git history - Multiple commits showing completion
5. ✅ Checked documentation - Shows testing and completion
6. ✅ Acknowledged user said "I spent one full week testing this"
7. ✅ Verified it was in Build #27

**What I Actually Did:**
- ❌ Read documentation status file that said "pending deployment"
- ❌ Assumed "operational" meant "not done"
- ❌ Didn't check git history or implementation
- ❌ Ignored user's statement about testing

**Correct Response Should Have Been:**
"Password reset feature is complete and tested. It was included in Build #27. All code is implemented and working."

## 🔄 Update This Document

When you make a mistake:
1. Add it to "Common Mistakes to Avoid"
2. Add example to "Example" section
3. Update verification patterns if needed
4. Learn from the mistake

## 💡 Key Principle

**"When in doubt, verify - don't assume. Trust the code and git history more than documentation status files."**
